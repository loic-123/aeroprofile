# AeroProfile

Open-source tool that computes a cyclist's **CdA** (aerodynamic drag area) and **Crr** (rolling resistance coefficient) from a power-meter activity file (`.fit`, `.gpx`, `.tcx`), with automatic historical wind correction via Open-Meteo.

Live demo: **https://aeroprofile.onrender.com**

**What makes it different**

- Analyses *any* regular ride — no need for a controlled protocol (no velodrome, no loops, no pre-arranged out-and-back).
- **3 solvers in cascade**: Wind-Inverse (jointly estimates wind + CdA), Chung Virtual Elevation, Martin LS — with automatic selection based on fit quality.
- **Iterative VE refinement (hybrid)**: 2-pass algorithm using both drift rate and absolute drift to exclude divergent segments, with a 30% safety cap to avoid over-trimming. Re-solves on clean data only.
- **Yaw-angle correction**: CdA reported is the zero-yaw "wind tunnel" value, corrected for crosswind effects (Crouch et al. 2014).
- **Per-point drafting filter**: detects and excludes segments where CdA_instantaneous < 0.12 for ≥30s (physically impossible solo).
- **Variable η(P)**: drivetrain efficiency varies with power per Spicer et al. (2001).
- **Martin 1998 complete**: wheel-bearing losses + wheel inertia (+0.14 kg) + 5s power smoothing.
- **Bike type selector** (Route / CLM-Triathlon / VTT-Gravel) with per-type CdA plausibility bounds for automatic ride exclusion.
- **4 analysis modes**:
  - **Single/multi-file upload** with drag & drop, local cache, quality-weighted averaging
  - **Multi-rider comparison** with drafting detection and W/CdA ranking
  - **Intervals.icu integration** — connect your account, filter rides by date/distance/D+, analyze a year of data in one click
  - **11 methodology articles** with KaTeX-rendered LaTeX formulas explaining every step of the pipeline
- **CdA Totem** — fun comparison of your CdA to a real-world object ("You're a dolphin 🐬").
- **VE exclusion zones** visible as grey bands on the altitude chart.
- Detects likely **power-meter calibration issues** and quantifies the probable offset in watts.

## How it works — details

### 1. Parse & derive

Multi-format parser (FIT, GPX with power extensions, TCX with Garmin namespaces) produces a unified `RideData`. The pipeline then computes per-point derivatives: Savitzky-Golay-smoothed altitude, gradient, acceleration, bearing, and a 5-second centred rolling mean on power (per Martin 1998).

### 2. Weather

For each ride we fetch **tiled historical weather** from Open-Meteo: one tile every **5 km** along the route (up to **20 tiles**, fetched sequentially with 300 ms delay to stay under rate limits). A 100 km ride gets ~20 weather anchor points — enough to capture valley/ridge wind gradients that a single centroid would miss. Temperature, humidity, surface pressure and wind are interpolated onto each sample via u/v-vector blending (so the 359°→1° wrap doesn't alias to 180°). Wind at 10 m is rescaled to rider height (1.3 m) with a logarithmic profile `v(z) = v_ref · ln(z/z₀) / ln(10/z₀)`, z₀ = 0.03 m in open terrain.

**Important**: even with tiled weather, Open-Meteo's ~10 km grid resolution means the wind at the rider can differ by 2-5 m/s from the API value — which is why the wind-inverse solver (see below) is so impactful.

### 3. Physics

We solve the Martin, Milliken, Cobb, McFadden & Coggan (1998) power equation, augmented with the paper's wheel-bearing losses and wheel-inertia terms:

```
P × η = P_aero + P_roll + P_grav + P_accel + P_bearings

  P_aero      = ½ · CdA · ρ · V_air² · V_ground
  P_roll      = Crr · m · g · cos(θ) · V_ground
  P_grav      = m · g · sin(θ) · V_ground
  P_accel     = (m + 0.14) · a · V_ground     [0.14 kg = wheel I/r²]
  P_bearings  = V · (91 + 8.7·V) × 10⁻³       [Dahn et al.]

η = 0.977 (drivetrain), ρ per-point from altitude + T + RH + surface pressure.
```

### 4. Filters

Each sample is tagged with 13 boolean filters (including per-point drafting detection). Defaults follow the Debraux/Chung consensus:

- `power < 50 W` (Martin threshold)
- `|acceleration| > 0.3 m/s²` (unsteady)
- `|yaw_rate| > 10°/s` (cornering)
- `gradient > +8%` (climbs dominated by gravity, low aero SNR)
- `gradient < -8%` (steep descents with braking/terminal velocity)
- rolling speed CV > 15% over 15 s
- power spikes > 3·NP, GPS jumps > 50 m, negative V_air, low speed < 3 m/s, stopped, zero power
- CdA_instantaneous < 0.12 for ≥30s continuous blocks at speed > 8 m/s (drafting detection)

Only **contiguous blocks of ≥ 30 s** of valid samples are kept. Mid-grade descents (-3% to -8%) are kept by default because their high V_air gives a strong aero signal.

After the initial solve, a **hybrid iterative refinement** (pass 2) detects and excludes segments where the virtual elevation diverges from reality, using two complementary criteria:
- **Drift rate** `d(drift)/dt > max(0.10, D+/duration × 4)` m/s — catches active divergence
- **Absolute drift** `|drift| > max(80 m, D+ × 12%)` — catches accumulated bias

If >30% of valid points would be excluded, refinement is skipped (model is globally poor). Excluded segments are shown as grey zones on the altitude chart.

### 5. Solver

Three estimators, tried in cascade (best R² wins):

1. **Wind-Inverse** (preferred) — jointly estimates **(CdA, Crr, wind speed, wind direction)** per 30-minute segment inside a Chung VE objective. The Open-Meteo wind serves as a Gaussian prior (σ = 2 m/s per component) so the solver adjusts the wind to what the data actually says rather than trusting a 10 km grid cell. Requires heading variance > 0.25 (the rider changed direction enough for wind to be identifiable separately from CdA). On rides with heading variety this typically **doubles the R²** (e.g. 0.50 → 0.98) by removing the dominant error source.

2. **Chung VE** (fallback) — minimises `Σ(altitude_real − altitude_virtual)²` from the integrated energy balance, per-block aligned so gaps don't drift. Wind is taken from the API (not estimated). Used when heading variance is too low (linear climbs, straight roads) or when wind-inverse doesn't improve on it.

3. **Martin LS** (baseline) — `scipy.optimize.least_squares` on per-point power residuals, multi-start (3 seeds), trust-region reflective.

All three share weak Gaussian priors on Crr ~ N(0.0035, 0.0012²) and CdA ~ N(0.30, 0.12²) to stabilise ill-conditioned fits. Confidence intervals come from the Jacobian at the MAP estimate (prior rows excluded).

### 6. Reporting

The dashboard reports:

- CdA and Crr with 95% intervals
- **RMSE in watts** as the headline error metric (more interpretable than R² on varied rides)
- **CdA by gradient regime** — separate estimates on flat, climbs, descents (asymmetry is diagnostic of wind error or real position change)
- Seven plots — altitude (real vs Chung-virtual), rolling CdA, power decomposition (aero/rolling/gravity/accel), P_model vs P_measured scatter, residuals histogram, CdA vs speed, and the route on a MapLibre basemap
- Eight anomaly categories: out-of-range CdA/Crr, wide CI, residual bias (quantified in W), temporal drift, climb/descent asymmetry, offset estimate, drafting suspicion
- A posture illustration matched to the estimated CdA, and derived watts-to-ride-at-V figures

## Compare mode

Upload several activity files at once (one per rider). AeroProfile runs each analysis in parallel, then:

- Ranks riders on best aero (lowest CdA), best rolling (lowest Crr), and overall drag at 40 km/h with each rider's own mass
- Shows a full comparison table with CdA, Crr, drag force, W/kg and R² per rider
- **Detects drafting between riders** — if two riders have the same average speed (±5%) but CdA differs by >15%, the lower-CdA one was almost certainly behind the other
- Shows each rider's posture silhouette side-by-side

## Physical reference

Typical CdA (m²) per position (Debraux et al. 2011):

| Position | CdA |
|---|---|
| TT pro (Superman) | 0.17 – 0.20 |
| TT amateur | 0.21 – 0.25 |
| Road, drops | 0.28 – 0.32 |
| Road, hoods | 0.32 – 0.38 |
| Road, tops | 0.38 – 0.45 |
| Upright / MTB | 0.45 – 0.55 |

Typical Crr:

| Tyre / surface | Crr |
|---|---|
| Velodrome tubular | 0.002 – 0.003 |
| Tubeless clincher, tarmac | 0.003 – 0.004 |
| Standard clincher | 0.004 – 0.006 |
| Rough tarmac | 0.006 – 0.008 |
| Gravel | 0.007 – 0.010 |

## Known limits

AeroProfile is a **field-estimation tool**, not a wind-tunnel replacement. It works best when:

- The ride has a variety of speeds and gradients (separates CdA from Crr)
- The power meter is calibrated and the rider's mass is correct (±2 kg)
- The ride is solo or of known drafting pattern
- The wind is light enough to be captured by Open-Meteo's ~10 km grid

Expected RMSE on unconstrained rides is **15-60 W** depending on drafting, wind error, and altitude noise. Martin et al.'s 1998 validation paper reports SEE = 2.7 W on a velodrome under controlled conditions — that ceiling is unreachable on open roads.

When R² is below 0 the tool marks CdA and Crr as "non-reliable" rather than showing an authoritative-looking number.

## Deploy

A single-service Render deployment is provided via `render.yaml`. FastAPI serves both the API (`/api/*`) and the built frontend (`frontend/dist/`) from the same domain.
